 * Starts and stops games, and keeps the lobby socket.
 *
 * The buttons that drive it are Preact (see shell/), so this listens for their
 * events rather than binding to elements, and reports back through the shared
 * HudData it hands to every game it starts.
 *
 * On load a tab that was in a room, and was reloaded, goes straight back in.
 * If this browser was in a room that is still running, the player is asked
 * whether to rejoin it, or told it has closed if they were in it recently.
 * Otherwise, or once they choose to stay, an offline game starts. The offline
 * game waits for that answer, since building it can keep a slow device too busy
 * to show the question. See RoomStore for what is remembered.
 *
 * The lobby socket is only opened when it is needed, so the game also works as a
 * static page with no server. Requests to the lobby have no timeout: building
 * the game can keep a slow device busy for seconds, which would race a timer
 * with the answer. A server that can not be reached fails to connect instead.
